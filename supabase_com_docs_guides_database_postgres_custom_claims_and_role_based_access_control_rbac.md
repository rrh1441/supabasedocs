# Custom Claims & Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

* * *

Custom Claims are special attributes attached to a user that you can use to control access to portions of your application. For example:

`
{
"user_role": "admin",
"plan": "TRIAL",
"user_level": 100,
"group_name": "Super Guild!",
"joined_on": "2022-05-20T14:28:18.217Z",
"group_manager": false,
"items": ["toothpick", "string", "ring"]
}
`

To implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with `custom claims`, use a [Custom Access Token Auth Hook](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-hooks#hook-custom-access-token). This hook runs before a token is issued. You can use it to add additional claims to the user's JWT.

This guide uses the [Slack Clone example](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/slack-clone/nextjs-slack-clone) to demonstrate how to add a `user_role` claim and use it in your [Row Level Security (RLS) policies](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security).

## Create a table to track user roles and permissions [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/custom-claims-and-role-based-access-control-rbac\#create-a-table-to-track-user-roles-and-permissions)

In this example, you will implement two user roles with specific permissions:

- `moderator`: A moderator can delete all messages but not channels.
- `admin`: An admin can delete all messages and channels.

supabase/migrations/init.sql

`
-- Custom types
create type public.app_permission as enum ('channels.delete', 'messages.delete');
create type public.app_role as enum ('admin', 'moderator');
-- USER ROLES
create table public.user_roles (
id        bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
user_id   uuid references auth.users on delete cascade not null,
role      app_role not null,
unique (user_id, role)
);
comment on table public.user_roles is 'Application roles for each user.';
-- ROLE PERMISSIONS
create table public.role_permissions (
id           bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
role         app_role not null,
permission   app_permission not null,
unique (role, permission)
);
comment on table public.role_permissions is 'Application permissions for each role.';
`

For the [full schema](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/examples/slack-clone/nextjs-slack-clone/README.md), see the example application on [GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/slack-clone/nextjs-slack-clone).

You can now manage your roles and permissions in SQL. For example, to add the mentioned roles and permissions from above, run:

supabase/seed.sql

`
insert into public.role_permissions (role, permission)
values
('admin', 'channels.delete'),
('admin', 'messages.delete'),
('moderator', 'messages.delete');
`

## Create Auth Hook to apply user role [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/custom-claims-and-role-based-access-control-rbac\#create-auth-hook-to-apply-user-role)

The [Custom Access Token Auth Hook](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-hooks#hook-custom-access-token) runs before a token is issued. You can use it to edit the JWT.

PL/pgSQL (best performance)JavaScript (PLV8)

supabase/migrations/auth\_hook.sql

`
-- Create the auth hook function
create or replace function public.custom_access_token_hook(event jsonb)
returns jsonb
language plpgsql
stable
as $$
declare
    claims jsonb;
    user_role public.app_role;
begin
    -- Fetch the user role in the user_roles table
    select role into user_role from public.user_roles where user_id = (event->>'user_id')::uuid;
    claims := event->'claims';
    if user_role is not null then
      -- Set the claim
      claims := jsonb_set(claims, '{user_role}', to_jsonb(user_role));
    else
      claims := jsonb_set(claims, '{user_role}', 'null');
    end if;
    -- Update the 'claims' object in the original event
    event := jsonb_set(event, '{claims}', claims);
    -- Return the modified or original event
    return event;
end;
$$;
grant usage on schema public to supabase_auth_admin;
grant execute
on function public.custom_access_token_hook
to supabase_auth_admin;
revoke execute
on function public.custom_access_token_hook
from authenticated, anon, public;
grant all
on table public.user_roles
to supabase_auth_admin;
revoke all
on table public.user_roles
from authenticated, anon, public;
create policy "Allow auth admin to read user roles" ON public.user_roles
as permissive for select
to supabase_auth_admin
using (true)
`

### Enable the hook [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/custom-claims-and-role-based-access-control-rbac\#enable-the-hook)

In the dashboard, navigate to [`Authentication > Hooks (Beta)`](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/hooks) and select the appropriate Postgres function from the dropdown menu.

When developing locally, follow the [local development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-hooks#local-development) instructions.

To learn more about Auth Hooks, see the [Auth Hooks docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-hooks).

## Accessing custom claims in RLS policies [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/custom-claims-and-role-based-access-control-rbac\#accessing-custom-claims-in-rls-policies)

To utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Row Level Security (RLS) policies, create an `authorize` method that reads the user's role from their JWT and checks the role's permissions:

supabase/migrations/init.sql

`
create or replace function public.authorize(
requested_permission app_permission
)
returns boolean as $$
declare
bind_permissions int;
user_role public.app_role;
begin
  -- Fetch user role once and store it to reduce number of calls
select (auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role')::public.app_role into user_role;
select count(*)
into bind_permissions
from public.role_permissions
where role_permissions.permission = requested_permission
    and role_permissions.role = user_role;
return bind_permissions > 0;
end;
$$ language plpgsql stable security definer set search_path = '';
`

You can read more about using functions in RLS policies in the [RLS guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#using-functions).

You can then use the `authorize` method within your RLS policies. For example, to enable the desired delete access, you would add the following policies:

`
create policy "Allow authorized delete access" on public.channels for delete to authenticated using ( (SELECT authorize('channels.delete')) );
create policy "Allow authorized delete access" on public.messages for delete to authenticated using ( (SELECT authorize('messages.delete')) );
`

## Accessing custom claims in your application [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/custom-claims-and-role-based-access-control-rbac\#accessing-custom-claims-in-your-application)

The auth hook will only modify the access token JWT but not the auth response. Therefore, to access the custom claims in your application, e.g. your browser client, or server-side middleware, you will need to decode the `access_token` JWT on the auth session.

In a JavaScript client application you can for example use the [`jwt-decode` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode):

`
import { jwtDecode } from 'jwt-decode'
const { subscription: authListener } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(async (event, session) => {
if (session) {
    const jwt = jwtDecode(session.access_token)
    const userRole = jwt.user_role
}
})
`

For server-side logic you can use packages like [`express-jwt`](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt), [`koa-jwt`](https://github.com/stiang/koa-jwt), [`PyJWT`](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt), [dart\_jsonwebtoken](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_jsonwebtoken), [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer), etc.

## Conclusion [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/custom-claims-and-role-based-access-control-rbac\#conclusion)

You now have a robust system in place to manage user roles and permissions within your database that automatically propagates to Supabase Auth.
