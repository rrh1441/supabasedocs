## Public buckets [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/serving/downloads\#public-buckets)

As mentioned in the [Buckets Fundamentals](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/buckets/fundamentals) all files uploaded in a public bucket are publicly accessible and benefit a high CDN cache HIT ratio.

You can access them by using this conventional URL:

`
https://[project_id].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/[bucket]/[asset-name]
`

You can also use the Supabase SDK `getPublicUrl` to generate this URL for you

`
const { data } = supabase.storage.from('bucket').getPublicUrl('filePath.jpg')
console.log(data.publicUrl)
`

### Downloading [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/serving/downloads\#downloading)

If you want the browser to start an automatic download of the asset instead of trying serving it, you can add the `?download` query string parameter.

By default it will use the asset name to save the file on disk. You can optionally pass a custom name to the `download` parameter as following: `?download=customname.jpg`

## Private buckets [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/serving/downloads\#private-buckets)

Assets stored in a non-public bucket are considered private and are not accessible via a public URL like the public buckets.

You can access them only by:

- Signing a time limited URL on the Server, for example with Edge Functions.
- with a GET request the URL `https://[project_id].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/authenticated/[bucket]/[asset-name]` and the user Authorization header

### Signing URLs [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/serving/downloads\#signing-urls)

You can sign a time-limited URL that you can share to your users by invoking the `createSignedUrl` method on the SDK.

`
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
.from('bucket')
.createSignedUrl('private-document.pdf', 3600)
if (data) {
console.log(data.signedUrl)
}
`
