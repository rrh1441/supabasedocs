# AI & Vectors

## The best vector database is the database you already have.

* * *

Supabase provides an open source toolkit for developing AI applications using Postgres and pgvector. Use the Supabase client libraries to store, index, and query your vector embeddings at scale.

The toolkit includes:

- A [vector store](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/vector-columns) and embeddings support using Postgres and pgvector.
- A [Python client](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/vecs-python-client) for managing unstructured embeddings.
- An [embedding generation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/quickstarts/generate-text-embeddings) process using open source models directly in Edge Functions.
- [Database migrations](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/examples/headless-vector-search#prepare-your-database) for managing structured embeddings.
- Integrations with all popular AI providers, such as [OpenAI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/examples/openai), [Hugging Face](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/hugging-face), [LangChain](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/langchain), and more.

## Search [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai\#search)

You can use Supabase to build different types of search features for your app, including:

- [Semantic search](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/semantic-search): search by meaning rather than exact keywords
- [Keyword search](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/keyword-search): search by words or phrases
- [Hybrid search](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/hybrid-search): combine semantic search with keyword search
