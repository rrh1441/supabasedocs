# Manage IPv4 usage

* * *

## What you are charged for [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/ipv4\#what-you-are-charged-for)

You can assign a dedicated [IPv4 address](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address) to a database by enabling the [IPv4 add-on](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons?panel=ipv4). You are charged for all IPv4 addresses configured across your databases.

If the primary database has a dedicated IPv4 address configured, its Read Replicas are also assigned one, with charges for each.

## How charges are calculated [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/ipv4\#how-charges-are-calculated)

IPv4 addresses are charged by the hour, meaning you are charged for the exact number of hours that an IPv4 address is assigned to a database. If an address is assigned for part of an hour, you are still charged for the full hour.

### Example [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/ipv4\#example)

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. On January 10 at 4:30 PM, you enable the IPv4 add-on for your project. At the end of the billing cycle you are billed for 512 hours.

| Time Window | IPv4 add-on | Hours Billed | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| January 1, 00:00 AM - January 10, 4:00 PM | Disabled | 0 |  |
| January 10, 04:00 PM - January 10, 4:30 PM | Disabled | 0 |  |
| January 10, 04:30 PM - January 10, 5:00 PM | Enabled | 1 | full hour is billed |
| January 10, 05:00 PM - January 31, 23:59 PM | Enabled | 511 |  |
