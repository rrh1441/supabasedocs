# Querying the logs

## Understanding field references [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#understanding-field-references)

The log tables are queried with a subset of BigQuery SQL syntax. They all have three columns: `event_message`, `timestamp`, and `metadata`.

| column | description |
| --- | --- |
| timestamp | time event was recorded |
| event\_message | the log's message |
| metadata | information about the event |

The `metadata` column is an array of JSON objects that stores important details about each recorded event. For example, in the Postgres table, the `metadata.parsed.error_severity` field indicates the error level of an event. To work with its values, you need to `unnest` them using a `cross join`.

This approach is commonly used with JSON and array columns, so it might look a bit unfamiliar if you're not used to working with these data types.

`
select
event_message,
parsed.error_severity,
parsed.user_name
from
postgres_logs
  -- extract first layer
cross join unnest(postgres_logs.metadata) as metadata
  -- extract second layer
cross join unnest(metadata.parsed) as parsed;
`

## Expanding results [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#expanding-results)

Logs returned by queries may be difficult to read in table format. A row can be double-clicked to expand the results into more readable JSON:

## Filtering with [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#filtering-with-regular-expressions)

The Logs use BigQuery Style regular expressions with the [regexp\_contains function](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#regexp_contains). In its most basic form, it will check if a string is present in a specified column.

`
select
cast(timestamp as datetime) as timestamp,
event_message,
metadata
from postgres_logs
where regexp_contains(event_message, 'is present');
`

There are multiple operators that you should consider using:

### Find messages that start with a phrase [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#find-messages-that-start-with-a-phrase)

`^` only looks for values at the start of a string

`
-- find only messages that start with connection
regexp_contains(event_message, '^connection')
`

### Find messages that end with a phrase: [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#find-messages-that-end-with-a-phrase)

`$` only looks for values at the end of the string

`
-- find only messages that ends with port=12345
regexp_contains(event_message, '$port=12345')
`

### Ignore case sensitivity: [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#ignore-case-sensitivity)

`(?i)` ignores capitalization for all proceeding characters

`
-- find all event_messages with the word "connection"
regexp_contains(event_message, '(?i)COnnecTion')
`

### Wildcards: [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#wildcards)

`.` can represent any string of characters

`
-- find event_messages like "hello<anything>world"
regexp_contains(event_message, 'hello.world')
`

### Alphanumeric ranges: [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#alphanumeric-ranges)

`[1-9a-zA-Z]` finds any strings with only numbers and letters

`
-- find event_messages that contain a number between 1 and 5 (inclusive)
regexp_contains(event_message, '[1-5]')
`

### Repeated values: [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#repeated-values)

`x*` zero or more x
`x+` one or more x
`x?` zero or one x
`x{4,}` four or more x
`x{3}` exactly 3 x

`
-- find event_messages that contains any sequence of 3 digits
regexp_contains(event_message, '[0-9]{3}')
`

### Escaping reserved characters: [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#escaping-reserved-characters)

`\.` interpreted as period `.` instead of as a wildcard

`
-- escapes .
regexp_contains(event_message, 'hello world\.')
`

### `or` statements: [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#or-statements)

`x|y` any string with `x` or `y` present

`
-- find event_messages that have the word 'started' followed by either the word "host" or "authenticated"
regexp_contains(event_message, 'started host|authenticated')
`

### `and`/ `or`/ `not` statements in SQL: [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#and--or--not-statements-in-sql)

`and`, `or`, and `not` are all native terms in SQL and can be used in conjunction with regular expressions to filter results

`
select
cast(timestamp as datetime) as timestamp,
event_message,
metadata
from postgres_logs
where
(regexp_contains(event_message, 'connection') and regexp_contains(event_message, 'host'))
or not regexp_contains(event_message, 'received');
`

### Filtering and unnesting example [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#filtering-and-unnesting-example)

**Filter for Postgres**

`
select
cast(postgres_logs.timestamp as datetime) as timestamp,
parsed.error_severity,
parsed.user_name,
event_message
from
postgres_logs
cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata
cross join unnest(metadata.parsed) as parsed
where regexp_contains(parsed.error_severity, 'ERROR|FATAL|PANIC')
order by timestamp desc
limit 100;
`

## Limitations [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#limitations)

### Log tables cannot be joined together [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#log-tables-cannot-be-joined-together)

Each product table operates independently without the ability to join with other log tables. This may change in the future.

### The `with` keyword and subqueries are not supported [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#the-with-keyword-and-subqueries-are-not-supported)

The parser does not yet support `with` and subquery statements.

### The `ilike` and `similar to` keywords are not supported [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#the-ilike-and-similar-to-keywords-are-not-supported)

Although `like` and other comparison operators can be used, `ilike` and `similar to` are incompatible with BigQuery's variant of SQL. `regexp_contains` can be used as an alternative.

### The wildcard operator `*` to select columns is not supported [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/advanced-log-filtering\#the-wildcard-operator--to-select-columns-is-not-supported)

The log parser is not able to parse the `*` operator for column selection. Instead, you can access all fields from the `metadata` column:

`
select
cast(postgres_logs.timestamp as datetime) as timestamp,
event_message,
metadata
from
<log_table_name>
order by timestamp desc
limit 100;
`
