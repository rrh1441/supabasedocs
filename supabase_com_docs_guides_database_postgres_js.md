### Connecting with Postgres.js [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres-js\#connecting-with-postgresjs)

[Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) is a full-featured Postgres client for Node.js and Deno.

1

### Install

Install Postgres.js and related dependencies.

`
npm i postgres
`

2

### Connect

Create a `db.js` file with the connection details.

To get your connection details, go to your [`Database Settings`](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database). Make sure `Use connection pooling` is enabled. Choose `Transaction Mode` if you're on a platform with transient connections, such as a serverless function, and `Session Mode` if you have a long-lived connection. Copy the URI and save it as the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`.

`
// db.js
import postgres from 'postgres'
const connectionString = process.env.DATABASE_URL
const sql = postgres(connectionString)
export default sql
`

3

### Execute commands

Use the connection to execute commands.

``
import sql from './db.js'
async function getUsersOver(age) {
const users = await sql`
    select name, age
    from users
    where age > ${ age }
`
// users = Result [{ name: "Walter", age: 80 }, { name: 'Murray', age: 68 }, ...]
return users
}
``
