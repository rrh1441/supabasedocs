* * *

## What you are charged for [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/edge-function-invocations\#what-you-are-charged-for)

You are charged for the number of times your functions get invoked, regardless of the response status code.

## How charges are calculated [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/edge-function-invocations\#how-charges-are-calculated)

Edge Function Invocations are billed using Package pricing, with each package representing 1 million invocations. If your usage falls between two packages, you are billed for the next whole package.

### Example [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/edge-function-invocations\#example)

For simplicity, let's assume a package size of 1 million and a charge of $2 per package without a free quota.

| Invocations | Packages Billed | Costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 999,999 | 1 | $2 |
| 1,000,000 | 1 | $2 |
| 1,000,001 | 2 | $4 |
| 1,500,000 | 2 | $4 |

### Usage on your invoice [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/edge-function-invocations\#usage-on-your-invoice)

Usage is shown as "Function Invocations" on your invoice.

## Pricing [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/edge-function-invocations\#pricing)

$2 per 1 million invocations. You are only charged for usage exceeding your subscription plan's quota.
