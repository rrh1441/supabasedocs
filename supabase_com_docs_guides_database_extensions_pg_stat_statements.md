# pg\_stat\_statements: Query Performance Monitoring

* * *

`pg_stat_statements` is a database extension that exposes a view, of the same name, to track statistics about SQL statements executed on the database. The following table shows some of the available statistics and metadata:

| Column Name | Column Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userid` | `oid` (references `pg_authid.oid`) | OID of user who executed the statement |
| `dbid` | `oid` (references `pg_database.oid`) | OID of database in which the statement was executed |
| `toplevel` | `bool` | True if the query was executed as a top-level statement (always true if pg\_stat\_statements.track is set to top) |
| `queryid` | `bigint` | Hash code to identify identical normalized queries. |
| `query` | `text` | Text of a representative statement |
| `plans` | `bigint` | Number of times the statement was planned (if pg\_stat\_statements.track\_planning is enabled, otherwise zero) |
| `total_plan_time` | `double precision` | Total time spent planning the statement, in milliseconds (if pg\_stat\_statements.track\_planning is enabled, otherwise zero) |
| `min_plan_time` | `double precision` | Minimum time spent planning the statement, in milliseconds (if pg\_stat\_statements.track\_planning is enabled, otherwise zero) |

A full list of statistics is available in the [pg\_stat\_statements docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html).

## Inspecting activity [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_stat_statements\#inspecting-activity)

A common use for `pg_stat_statements` is to track down expensive or slow queries. The `pg_stat_statements` view contains a row for each executed query with statistics inlined. For example, you can leverage the statistics to identify frequently executed and slow queries against a given table.

`
select
	calls,
	mean_exec_time,
	max_exec_time,
	total_exec_time,
	stddev_exec_time,
	query
from
	pg_stat_statements
where
    calls > 50                   -- at least 50 calls
    and mean_exec_time > 2.0     -- averaging at least 2ms/call
    and total_exec_time > 60000  -- at least one minute total server time spent
    and query ilike '%user_in_organization%' -- filter to queries that touch the user_in_organization table
order by
	calls desc
`

From the results, we can make an informed decision about which queries to optimize or index.
