# Manage Monthly Active Users usage

* * *

## What you are charged for [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/monthly-active-users\#what-you-are-charged-for)

You are charged for the number of distinct users who log in or refresh their token during the billing cycle. Each unique user is counted only once per billing cycle, regardless of how many times they authenticate. These users are referred to as "MAUs".

### Example [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/monthly-active-users\#example)

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. Although User-1 was signed in multiple times, they are counted as a single MAU for this billing cycle.

1

### Sign User-1 in on January 3

The MAU count increases from 0 to 1.

`
const {data, error} = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
email: 'user-1@email.com',
password: 'example-password-1',
})
`

2

### Sign User-1 out on January 4

`javascript const {error} = await supabase.auth.signOut() `

3

### Sign User-1 in again on January 17

The MAU count remains 1.

`
const {data, error} = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
email: 'user-1@email.com',
password: 'example-password-1',
})
`
