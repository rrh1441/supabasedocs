# Realtime

## Send and receive messages to connected clients.

* * *

Supabase provides a globally distributed cluster of [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime) servers that enable the following functionality:

- [Broadcast](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast): Send ephemeral messages from client to clients with low latency.
- [Presence](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/presence): Track and synchronize shared state between clients.
- [Postgres Changes](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes): Listen to Postgres database changes and send them to authorized clients.

### Realtime API [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime\#realtime-api)

By default Realtime is disabled on your database. Let's turn on Realtime for a `todos` table.

DashboardSQL

1. Go to the [Database](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click on **Publications** in the sidebar.
3. Control which database events are sent by toggling **Insert**, **Update**, and **Delete**.
4. Control which tables broadcast changes by selecting **Source** and toggling each table.

From the client, we can listen to any new data that is inserted into the `todos` table:

JavaScriptDartSwiftPython

`
// Initialize the JS client
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
// Create a function to handle inserts
const handleInserts = (payload) => {
console.log('Change received!', payload)
}
// Listen to inserts
supabase
.channel('todos')
.on('postgres_changes', { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'todos' }, handleInserts)
.subscribe()
`

Use [subscribe()](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/subscribe) to listen to database changes.
The Realtime API works through PostgreSQL's replication functionality. Postgres sends database changes to a [publication](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/replication#publications)
called `supabase_realtime`, and by managing this publication you can control which data is broadcast.
