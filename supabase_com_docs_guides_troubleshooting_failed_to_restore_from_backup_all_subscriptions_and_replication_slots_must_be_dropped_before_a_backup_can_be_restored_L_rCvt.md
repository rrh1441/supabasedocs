# Failed to restore from backup: All subscriptions and replication slots must be dropped before a backup can be restored.

As the error suggests, you must first drop any current subscriptions or replication slots to restore backups.

You can check those with:

`
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;
SELECT * FROM pg_subscription;
`

You can drop them with:

`
DROP SUBSCRIPTION <subscription>;
SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot(slot_name);
`

NOTE: These are destructive actions. This is fine since you will overwrite your database with a backup.
