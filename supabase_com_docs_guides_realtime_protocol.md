Realtime

# Realtime Protocol

* * *

The Realtime Protocol is a set of message formats used for communication over a WebSocket connection between a Realtime client and server. These messages are used to initiate a connection, update access tokens, receive system status updates, and receive real-time updates from the Postgres database.

## Connection [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/protocol\#connection)

In the initial message, the client sends a message specifying the features they want to use (Broadcast, Presence, Postgres Changes).

`
{
"event": "phx_join",
"topic": string,
"payload": {
      "config": {
         "broadcast": {
            "self": boolean
         },
         "presence": {
            "key": string
         },
         "postgres_changes": [\
            {\
               "event": "*" | "INSERT" | "UPDATE" | "DELETE",\
               "schema": string,\
               "table": string,\
               "filter": string + '=' + "eq" | "neq" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte" | "in" +  '.' + string\
            }\
         ]
      }
},
"ref": string
}
`

The `in` filter has the format `COLUMN_NAME=in.(value1,value2,value3)`. However, other filters use the format `COLUMN_NAME=FILTER_NAME.value`.

In response, the server sends the Postgres configuration with a unique ID. With this ID, the client should route incoming changes to the appropriate callback.

`
{
"event": "phx_reply",
"topic": string,
"payload": {
      "response": {
         "postgres_changes": [\
            {\
               "id": number,\
               "event": "*" | "INSERT" | "UPDATE" | "DELETE",\
               "schema": string,\
               "table": string,\
               "filter": string + '=' + "eq" | "neq" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte" | "in" +  '.' + string\
            }\
         ]
      },
      "status": "ok" | "error"
},
"ref": string
}
`

## System messages [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/protocol\#system-messages)

System message are used to inform a client about the status of the Postgres subscription. The `payload.status` indicates if the subscription successful or not.
The body of the `payload.message` can be "Subscribed to Postgres" or "Subscribing to Postgres failed" with subscription params.

`
{
"event": "system",
"topic": string,
"payload":{
      "channel": string,
      "extension": "postgres_changes",
      "message": "Subscribed to PostgreSQL" | "Subscribing to PostgreSQL failed",
      "status": "ok" | "error"
},
"ref": null,
}
`

## Heartbeat [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/protocol\#heartbeat)

The heartbeat message should be sent every 30 seconds to avoid a connection timeout.

`
{
"event": "heartbeat",
"topic": "phoenix",
"payload": {},
"ref": string
}
`

## Access token [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/protocol\#access-token)

To update the access token, you need to send to the server a message specifying a new token in the `payload.access_token` value.

`
{
"event": "access_token",
"topic": string,
"payload":{
      "access_token": string
},
"ref": string
}
`

## Postgres CDC message [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/protocol\#postgres-cdc-message)

Realtime sends a message with the following structure. By default, the payload only includes new record changes, and the `old` entry includes the changed row's primary id. If you want to receive old records, you can set the replicate identity of your table to full. Check out [this section of the guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes#receiving-old-records).

`
{
"event": "postgres_changes",
"topic": string,
"payload": {
      "data": {
         schema: string,
         table: string,
         commit_timestamp: string,
         eventType: "*" | "INSERT" | "UPDATE" | "DELETE",
         new: {[key: string]: boolean | number | string | null},
         old: {[key: string]: number | string},
         errors: string | null
      },
      "ids": Array<number>
},
"ref": null
}
`

## Broadcast message [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/protocol\#broadcast-message)

Structure of the broadcast event

`
{
"event": "broadcast",
"topic": string,
"payload": {
      "event": string,
      "payload": {[key: string]: boolean | number | string | null | undefined},
      "type": "broadcast"
},
"ref": null
}
`

## Presence message [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/protocol\#presence-message)

The Presence events allow clients to monitor the online status of other clients in real-time.

### State update [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/protocol\#state-update)

After joining, the server sends a `presence_state` message to a client with presence information. The payload field contains keys in UUID format, where each key represents a client and its value is a JSON object containing information about that client.

`
{
"event": "presence_state",
"topic": string,
"payload": {
      [key: string]: {metas: Array<{phx_ref: string, name: string, t: float}>}
},
"ref": null
}
`

### Diff update [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/protocol\#diff-update)

After a change to the presence state, such as a client joining or leaving, the server sends a presence\_diff message to update the client's view of the presence state. The payload field contains two keys, `joins` and `leaves`, which represent clients that have joined and left, respectively. The values associated with each key are UUIDs of the clients.

`
{
"event": "presence_diff",
"topic": string,
"payload": {
      "joins": {metas: Array<{phx_ref: string, name: string, t: float}>},
      "leaves": {metas: Array<{phx_ref: string, name: string, t: float}>}
},
"ref": null
}
`
