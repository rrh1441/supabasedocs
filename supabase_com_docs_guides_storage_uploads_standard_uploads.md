# Standard Uploads

## Learn how to upload files to Supabase Storage.

## Uploading [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads\#uploading)

The standard file upload method is ideal for small files that are not larger than 6MB.

It uses the traditional `multipart/form-data` format and is simple to implement using the supabase-js SDK. Here's an example of how to upload a file using the standard upload method:

Though you can upload up to 5GB files using the standard upload method, we recommend using [TUS Resumable Upload](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/resumable-uploads) for uploading files greater than 6MB in size for better reliability.

JavaScriptDartSwiftKotlinPython

`
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
// Create Supabase client
const supabase = createClient('your_project_url', 'your_supabase_api_key')
// Upload file using standard upload
async function uploadFile(file) {
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage.from('bucket_name').upload('file_path', file)
if (error) {
    // Handle error
} else {
    // Handle success
}
}
`

## Overwriting files [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads\#overwriting-files)

When uploading a file to a path that already exists, the default behavior is to return a `400 Asset Already Exists` error.
If you want to overwrite a file on a specific path you can set the `upsert` options to `true` or using the `x-upsert` header.

JavaScriptDartSwiftKotlinPython

`
// Create Supabase client
const supabase = createClient('your_project_url', 'your_supabase_api_key')
await supabase.storage.from('bucket_name').upload('file_path', file, {
upsert: true,
})
`

We do advise against overwriting files when possible, as our Content Delivery Network will take sometime to propagate the changes to all the edge nodes leading to stale content.
Uploading a file to a new path is the recommended way to avoid propagation delays and stale content.

## Content type [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads\#content-type)

By default, Storage will assume the content type of an asset from the file extension. If you want to specify the content type for your asset, pass the `contentType` option during upload.

JavaScriptDartSwiftKotlinPython

`
// Create Supabase client
const supabase = createClient('your_project_url', 'your_supabase_api_key')
await supabase.storage.from('bucket_name').upload('file_path', file, {
contentType: 'image/jpeg',
})
`

## Concurrency [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads\#concurrency)

When two or more clients upload a file to the same path, the first client to complete the upload will succeed and the other clients will receive a `400 Asset Already Exists` error.
If you provide the `x-upsert` header the last client to complete the upload will succeed instead.
