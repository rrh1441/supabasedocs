The time required for a PIT restoration isn't fixed. It depends on several factors:

**Time Since Last Full Backup:**

Full backups occur weekly. The time elapsed since the last full backup can affect restoration time.

**Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Activity:**

The volume of WAL activity since the last full backup is a critical factor. More activity can lead to longer restoration times.

**Database Size:**

While important, the size of the database isn't the sole determinant of restoration time.
