### Creating a client [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/migrating-to-ssr-from-auth-helpers\#creating-a-client)

The new `ssr` package exports two functions for creating a Supabase client. The `createBrowserClient` function is used in the client, and the `createServerClient` function is used in the server.

Check out the [Creating a client](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/creating-a-client) page for examples of creating a client in your framework.
