[Redis](https://redis.io/docs/about/) is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. It is optimized for atomic operations like incrementing a value, for example for a view counter or rate limiting. We can even rate limit based on the user ID from Supabase Auth!

[Upstash](https://upstash.com/) provides an HTTP/REST based Redis client which is ideal for serverless use-cases and therefore works well with Supabase Edge Functions.

Find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/edge-functions/supabase/functions/upstash-redis-ratelimit).
