Auth

# Supabase Auth with Next.js Pages Directory

* * *

The `auth-helpers` package has been replaced with the `@supabase/ssr` package. We recommend setting up Auth for your Next.js app with `@supabase/ssr` instead. See the [Next.js Server-Side Auth guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/nextjs?router=pages) to learn how.
