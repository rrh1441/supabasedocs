# pg\_hashids: Short UIDs

* * *

[pg\_hashids](https://github.com/iCyberon/pg_hashids) provides a secure way to generate short, unique, non-sequential ids from numbers. The hashes are intended to be small, easy-to-remember identifiers that can be used to obfuscate data (optionally) with a password, alphabet, and salt. For example, you may wish to hide data like user IDs, order numbers, or tracking codes in favor of `pg_hashid`'s unique identifiers.

## Usage [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_hashids\#usage)

Suppose we have a table that stores order information, and we want to give customers a unique identifier without exposing the sequential `id` column. To do this, we can use `pg_hashid`'s `id_encode` function.

`
create table orders (
id serial primary key,
description text,
price_cents bigint
);
insert into orders (description, price_cents)
values ('a book', 9095);
select
id,
id_encode(id) as short_id,
description,
price_cents
from
orders;
id | short_id | description | price_cents
----+----------+-------------+-------------
1 | jR       | a book      |        9095
(1 row)
`

To reverse the `short_id` back into an `id`, there is an equivalent function named `id_decode`.
