# Migrated from Firebase Storage to Supabase

## Migrate Firebase Storage files to Supabase Storage.

* * *

Supabase provides several [tools](https://github.com/supabase-community/firebase-to-supabase/tree/main/storage) to convert storage files from Firebase Storage to Supabase Storage. Conversion is a two-step process:

1. Files are downloaded from a Firebase storage bucket to a local filesystem.
2. Files are uploaded from the local filesystem to a Supabase storage bucket.

## Set up the migration tool [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-to-supabase/firebase-storage\#set-up-migration-tool)

1. Clone the [`firebase-to-supabase`](https://github.com/supabase-community/firebase-to-supabase) repository:



`
git clone https://github.com/supabase-community/firebase-to-supabase.git
`

2. In the `/storage` directory, rename [supabase-keys-sample.js](https://github.com/supabase-community/firebase-to-supabase/blob/main/storage/supabase-keys-sample.js) to `supabase-keys.js`.

3. Go to your Supabase project's [API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api) in the Dashboard.

4. Copy the **Project URL** and update the `SUPABASE_URL` value in `supabase-keys.js`.

5. Under **Project API keys**, copy the **service\_role** key and update the `SUPABASE_KEY` value in `supabase-keys.js`.


## Generate a Firebase private key [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-to-supabase/firebase-storage\#generate-firebase-private-key)

1. Log in to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project) and open your project.
2. Click the gear icon next to **Project Overview** in the sidebar and select **Project Settings**.
3. Click **Service Accounts** and select **Firebase Admin SDK**.
4. Click **Generate new private key**.
5. Rename the downloaded file to `firebase-service.json`.

## Command line options [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-to-supabase/firebase-storage\#command-line-options)

### Download Firestore Storage bucket to a local filesystem folder [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-to-supabase/firebase-storage\#download-firestore-storage-bucket)

`node download.js <prefix> [<folder>] [<batchSize>] [<limit>] [<token>]`

- `<prefix>`: The prefix of the files to download. To process the root bucket, use an empty prefix: "".
- `<folder>`: (optional) Name of subfolder for downloaded files. The selected folder is created as a subfolder of the current folder (e.g., `./downloads/`). The default is `downloads`.
- `<batchSize>`: (optional) The default is 100.
- `<limit>`: (optional) Stop after processing this many files. For no limit, use `0`.
- `<token>`: (optional) Begin processing at this `pageToken`.

To process in batches using multiple command-line executions, you must use the same parameters with a new `<token>` on subsequent calls. Use the token displayed on the last call to continue the process at a given point.

### Upload files to Supabase Storage bucket [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-to-supabase/firebase-storage\#upload-to-supabase-storage-bucket)

`node upload.js <prefix> <folder> <bucket>`

- `<prefix>`: The prefix of the files to download. To process all files, use an empty prefix: "".
- `<folder>`: Name of subfolder of files to upload. The selected folder is read as a subfolder of the current folder (e.g., `./downloads/`). The default is `downloads`.
- `<bucket>`: Name of the bucket to upload to.

If the bucket doesn't exist, it's created as a `non-public` bucket. You must set permissions on this new bucket in the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/storage/buckets) before users can download any files.
