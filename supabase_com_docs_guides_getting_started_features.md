## Feature status [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/features\#feature-status)

Supabase Features are in 4 different states - Private Alpha, Public Alpha, Beta and Generally Available.

### Private alpha [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/features\#private-alpha)

Features are initially launched as a private alpha to gather feedback from the community. To join our early access program, send an email to [product-ops@supabase.io](mailto:product-ops@supabase.io).

### Public alpha [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/features\#public-alpha)

The alpha stage indicates that the API might change in the future, not that the service isn’t stable. Even though the [uptime Service Level Agreement](https://supabase.com/sla) does not cover products in Alpha, we do our best to have the service as stable as possible.

### Beta [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/features\#beta)

Features in Beta are tested by an external penetration tester for security issues. The API is guaranteed to be stable and there is a strict communication process for breaking changes.

### Generally available [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/features\#generally-available)

In addition to the Beta requirements, features in GA are covered by the [uptime SLA](https://supabase.com/sla).
