# Manage Monthly Active SSO Users usage

* * *

## What you are charged for [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/monthly-active-users-sso\#what-you-are-charged-for)

You are charged for the number of distinct users who log in or refresh their token during the billing cycle using a SAML 2.0 compatible identity provider. Each unique user is counted only once per billing cycle, regardless of how many times they authenticate. These users are referred to as "SSO MAUs".

### Example [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/monthly-active-users-sso\#example)

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. Although User-1 was signed in multiple times, they are counted as a single SSO MAU for this billing cycle.

1

### Sign User-1 in on January 3

The SSO MAU count increases from 0 to 1.

`
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithSSO({
domain: 'company.com'
})
if (data?.url) {
// redirect User-1 to the identity provider's authentication flow
window.location.href = data.url
}
`

2

### Sign User-1 out on January 4

`javascript const {error} = await supabase.auth.signOut() `

3

### Sign User-1 in again on January 17

The SSO MAU count remains 1.

`
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithSSO({
domain: 'company.com'
})
if (data?.url) {
// redirect User-1 to the identity provider's authentication flow
window.location.href = data.url
}
`
