# Creating a Supabase client for SSR

## Configure your Supabase client to use cookies

* * *

To use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Supabase, you need to configure your Supabase client to use cookies. The `@supabase/ssr` package helps you do this for JavaScript/TypeScript applications.

## Install [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/creating-a-client\#install)

Install the `@supabase/ssr` and `@supabase/supabase-js` packages:

npmyarnpnpm

`
npm install @supabase/ssr @supabase/supabase-js
`

## Set environment variables [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/creating-a-client\#set-environment-variables)

In your environment variables file, set your Supabase URL and Supabase Anon Key:

###### Project URL

No project found

To get your Project URL, [log in](https://supabase.com/dashboard).

###### Anon key

No project found

To get your Anon key, [log in](https://supabase.com/dashboard).

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
`

## Create a client [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/creating-a-client\#create-a-client)

You'll need some one-time setup code to configure your Supabase client to use cookies. Once your utility code is set up, you can use your new `createClient` utility functions to get a properly configured Supabase client.

Use the browser client in code that runs on the browser, and the server client in code that runs on the server.
