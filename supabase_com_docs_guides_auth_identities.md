Auth

# Identities

* * *

An identity is an authentication method associated with a user. Supabase Auth supports the following types of identity:

- Email
- Phone
- OAuth
- SAML

A user can have more than one identity. Anonymous users have no identity until they link an identity to their user.

## The user identity object [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/identities\#the-user-identity-object)

The user identity object contains the following attributes:

| Attributes | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| provider\_id | `string` | The provider id returned by the provider. If the provider is an OAuth provider, the id refers to the user's account with the OAuth provider. If the provider is `email` or `phone`, the id is the user's id from the `auth.users` table. |
| user\_id | `string` | The user's id that the identity is linked to. |
| identity\_data | `object` | The identity metadata. For OAuth and SAML identities, this contains information about the user from the provider. |
| id | `string` | The unique id of the identity. |
| provider | `string` | The provider name. |
| email | `string` | The email is a generated column that references the optional email property in the identity\_data |
| created\_at | `string` | The timestamp that the identity was created. |
| last\_sign\_in\_at | `string` | The timestamp that the identity was last used to sign in. |
| updated\_at | `string` | The timestamp that the identity was last updated. |
