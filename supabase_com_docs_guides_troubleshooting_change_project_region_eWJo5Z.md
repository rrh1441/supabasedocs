The process to change the region of a Supabase Project is to create a new project in the desired region and migrate your existing project to the new project using this guide: [https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database#migrating-between-projects](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database#migrating-between-projects)

If you are using third-party auth(Facebook, Google, etc.), you need to manually copy over your client id/secret pairs in the dashboard. Also, you'd need to change your API URL/Anon or Service Keys, which is usually done via ENV vars on your web host.
