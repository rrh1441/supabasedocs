# Manage Advanced MFA Phone usage

* * *

## What you are charged for [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/advanced-mfa-phone\#what-you-are-charged-for)

You are charged for having the feature [Advanced Multi-Factor Authentication Phone](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-mfa/phone) enabled for your project.

Additional charges apply for each SMS or WhatsApp message sent, depending on your third-party messaging provider (such as Twilio or MessageBird).

## How charges are calculated [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/advanced-mfa-phone\#how-charges-are-calculated)

MFA Phone is charged by the hour, meaning you are charged for the exact number of hours that the feature is enabled for a project. If the feature is enabled for part of an hour, you are still charged for the full hour.

### Example [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/advanced-mfa-phone\#example)

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. On January 10 at 4:30 PM, you enable the MFA Phone feature for your project. At the end of the billing cycle you are billed for 512 hours.
