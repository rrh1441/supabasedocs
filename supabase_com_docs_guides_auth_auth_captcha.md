# Enable CAPTCHA Protection

* * *

Supabase provides you with the option of adding CAPTCHA to your sign-in, sign-up, and password reset forms. This keeps your website safe from bots and malicious scripts. Supabase authentication has support for [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) and [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/).

## Sign up for CAPTCHA [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-captcha\#sign-up-for-captcha)

HCaptchaTurnstile

Go to the [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) website and sign up for an account. On the Welcome page, copy the **Sitekey** and **Secret key**.

If you have already signed up and didn't copy this information from the Welcome page, you can get the **Secret key** from the Settings page.

The **Sitekey** can be found in the **Settings** of the active site you created.

In the Settings page, look for the **Sitekey** section and copy the key.

## Enable CAPTCHA protection for your Supabase project [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-captcha\#enable-captcha-protection-for-your-supabase-project)

Navigate to the **[Auth](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/auth)** section of your Project Settings in the Supabase Dashboard and find the **Enable CAPTCHA protection** toggle under Settings > Authentication > Bot and Abuse Protection > Enable CAPTCHA protection.

Select your CAPTCHA provider from the dropdown, enter your CAPTCHA **Secret key**, and click **Save**.

## Add the CAPTCHA frontend component [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-captcha\#add-the-captcha-frontend-component)

The frontend requires some changes to provide the CAPTCHA on-screen for the user. This example uses React and the corresponding CAPTCHA React component, but both CAPTCHA providers can be used with any JavaScript framework.

HCaptchaTurnstile

Install `@hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha` in your project as a dependency.

`
npm install @hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha
`

Now import the `HCaptcha` component from the `@hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha` library.

`
import HCaptcha from '@hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha'
`

Let's create a empty state to store our `captchaToken`

`
const [captchaToken, setCaptchaToken] = useState()
`

Now lets add the `HCaptcha` component to the JSX section of our code

`
<HCaptcha />
`

We will pass it the sitekey we copied from the hCaptcha website as a property along with a `onVerify` property which takes a callback function. This callback function will have a token as one of its properties. Let's set the token in the state using `setCaptchaToken`

`
<HCaptcha
sitekey="your-sitekey"
onVerify={(token) => {
    setCaptchaToken(token)
}}
/>
`

Now lets use the CAPTCHA token we receive in our Supabase signUp function.

`
await supabase.auth.signUp({
email,
password,
options: { captchaToken },
})
`

We will also need to reset the CAPTCHA challenge after we have made a call to the function above.

Create a ref to use on our `HCaptcha` component.

`
const captcha = useRef()
`

Let's add a ref attribute on the `HCaptcha` component and assign the `captcha` constant to it.

`
<HCaptcha
ref={captcha}
sitekey="your-sitekey"
onVerify={(token) => {
    setCaptchaToken(token)
}}
/>
`

Reset the `captcha` after the signUp function is called using the following code:

`
captcha.current.resetCaptcha()
`

In order to test that this works locally we will need to use something like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or add an entry to your hosts file. You can read more about this in the [hCaptcha docs](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/#local-development).

Run the application and you should now be provided with a CAPTCHA challenge.
