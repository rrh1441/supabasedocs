## Credit balance [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/credits\#credit-balance)

Each organization has a credit balance. Credits are applied to future invoices to reduce the amount due. As long as the credit balance is greater than $0, credits will be used before charging your payment method on file.

You can find the credit balance on the [organization's billing page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing).

### What causes the credit balance to change? [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/credits\#what-causes-the-credit-balance-to-change)

**Subscription plan downgrades:** Upon subscription downgrade, any prepaid subscription fee will be credited back to your organization for unused time in the billing cycle.

As an example, if you start a Pro Plan subscription on January 1 and downgrade to the Free Plan on January 15, your organization will receive about 50% of the subscription fee as credits for the unused time between January 15 and January 31.

**Credit top-ups:** You self-served a credit top-up or have signed an upfront credits deal with our growth team.

## Credit top-ups [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/credits\#credit-top-ups)

You can top up credits at any time, with a maximum of $999 per top-up. These credits do not expire and are non-refundable.

You may want to consider this option to avoid issues with recurring payments, gain more control over how often your credit card is charged, and potentially make things easier for your accounting department.
