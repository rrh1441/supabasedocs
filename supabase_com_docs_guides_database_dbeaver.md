### Get Your Credentials

Inside the Dashboard's [Database Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database), note your session mode's:

- host
- username

You will also need your database's password. If you forgot it, you can generate a new one in the settings.

If you're in an [IPv6 environment](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27034) or have the IPv4 Add-On, you can use the direct connection string instead of Supavisor in Session mode.
