# RUM: improved inverted index for full-text search based on GIN index

* * *

[RUM](https://github.com/postgrespro/rum) is an extension which adds a RUM index to Postgres.

RUM index is based on GIN that stores additional per-entry information in a posting tree. For example, positional information of lexemes or timestamps. In comparison to GIN it can use this information to make faster index-only scans for:

- Phrase search
- Text search with ranking by text distance operator
- Text `SELECT` s with ordering by some non-indexed additional column e.g. by timestamp.

RUM works best in scenarios when the possible keys are highly repeatable. I.e. all texts are composed of a
limited amount of words, so per-lexeme indexing gives significant speed-up in searching texts containing word
combinations or phrases.

Main operators for ordering are:

`tsvector` `<=>` `tsquery` \| `float4` \| Distance between `tsvector` and `tsquery`.
value `<=>` value \| `float8` \| Distance between two values.

Where value is `timestamp`, `timestamptz`, `int2`, `int4`, `int8`, `float4`, `float8`, `money` and `oid`

## Usage [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/rum\#usage)

### Enable the extension [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/rum\#enable-the-extension)

You can get started with rum by enabling the extension in your Supabase dashboard.

DashboardSQL

1. Go to the [Database](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click on **Extensions** in the sidebar.
3. Search for "rum" and enable the extension.

### Syntax [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/rum\#syntax)

#### For type: `tsvector` [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/rum\#for-type-tsvector)

To understand the following you may need first to see [Official Postgres documentation on text\\
search](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-textsearch.html)

`rum_tsvector_ops`

`
CREATE TABLE test_rum(t text, a tsvector);
CREATE TRIGGER tsvectorupdate
BEFORE UPDATE OR INSERT ON test_rum
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE tsvector_update_trigger('a', 'pg_catalog.english', 't');
INSERT INTO test_rum(t) VALUES ('The situation is most beautiful');
INSERT INTO test_rum(t) VALUES ('It is a beautiful');
INSERT INTO test_rum(t) VALUES ('It looks like a beautiful place');
CREATE INDEX rumidx ON test_rum USING rum (a rum_tsvector_ops);
`

And we can execute `tsvector` selects with ordering by text distance operator:

``
SELECT t, a `<=>` to_tsquery('english', 'beautiful | place') AS rank
    FROM test_rum
    WHERE a @@ to_tsquery('english', 'beautiful | place')
    ORDER BY a `<=>` to_tsquery('english', 'beautiful | place');
                t                |  rank
---------------------------------+---------
It looks like a beautiful place | 8.22467
The situation is most beautiful | 16.4493
It is a beautiful               | 16.4493
(3 rows)
``

`rum_tsvector_addon_ops`

`
CREATE TABLE tsts (id int, t tsvector, d timestamp);
CREATE INDEX tsts_idx ON tsts USING rum (t rum_tsvector_addon_ops, d)
    WITH (attach = 'd', to = 't');
`

Now we can execute the selects with ordering distance operator on attached column:

``
SELECT id, d, d `<=>` '2016-05-16 14:21:25' FROM tsts WHERE t @@ 'wr&qh' ORDER BY d `<=>` '2016-05-16 14:21:25' LIMIT 5;
id  |                d                |   ?column?
-----+---------------------------------+---------------
355 | Mon May 16 14:21:22.326724 2016 |      2.673276
354 | Mon May 16 13:21:22.326724 2016 |   3602.673276
371 | Tue May 17 06:21:22.326724 2016 |  57597.326724
406 | Wed May 18 17:21:22.326724 2016 | 183597.326724
415 | Thu May 19 02:21:22.326724 2016 | 215997.326724
(5 rows)
``

#### For type: `anyarray` [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/rum\#for-type-anyarray)

`rum_anyarray_ops`

This operator class stores `anyarray` elements with length of the array. It supports operators `&&`, `@>`, `<@`, `=`, `%` operators. It also supports ordering by `<=>` operator.

`
CREATE TABLE test_array (i int2[]);
INSERT INTO test_array VALUES ('{}'), ('{0}'), ('{1,2,3,4}'), ('{1,2,3}'), ('{1,2}'), ('{1}');
CREATE INDEX idx_array ON test_array USING rum (i rum_anyarray_ops);
`

Now we can execute the query using index scan:

``
SELECT * FROM test_array WHERE i && '{1}' ORDER BY i `<=>` '{1}' ASC;
     i
-----------
{1}
{1,2}
{1,2,3}
{1,2,3,4}
(4 rows)
``

`rum_anyarray_addon_ops`

The does the same with `anyarray` index as `rum_tsvector_addon_ops` i.e. allows to order select results using distance
operator by attached column.

## Limitations [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/rum\#limitations)

`RUM` has slower build and insert times than `GIN` due to:

1. It is bigger due to the additional attributes stored in the index.
2. It uses generic WAL records.
