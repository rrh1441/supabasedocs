# Migrate from Neon to Supabase

## Migrate your existing Neon database to Supabase.

* * *

This guide demonstrates how to migrate your Neon database to Supabase to get the most out of Postgres while gaining access to all the features you need to build a project.

## Retrieve your Neon database credentials [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-to-supabase/neon\#retrieve-credentials)

1. Log in to your Neon Console [https://console.neon.tech/login](https://console.neon.tech/login).
2. Select **Projects** on the left.
3. Click on your project in the list.
4. From your Project Dashboard find your **Connection string** and click **Copy snippet** to copy it to the clipboard (do not check "pooled connection").

Example:

`
postgresql://neondb_owner:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-random-word-yyyyyyyy.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
`

## Set your `OLD_DB_URL` environment variable [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-to-supabase/neon\#set-your-olddburl-environment-variable)

Set the **OLD\_DB\_URL** environment variable at the command line using your Neon database credentials from the clipboard.

Example:

`
export OLD_DB_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-random-word-yyyyyyyy.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
`

## Retrieve your Supabase connection string [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-to-supabase/neon\#retrieve-supabase-connection-string)

1. If you're new to Supabase, [create a project](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
Make a note of your password, you will need this later. If you forget it, you can [reset it here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database).

2. Go to the [Database settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database) for your project in the Supabase Dashboard.

3. Under **Connection string**, select **URI**, make sure **Display connection pooler** is checked, and **Mode: Session** is set.

4. Click the **Copy** button to the right of your connection string to copy it to the clipboard.


## Set your `NEW_DB_URL` environment variable [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-to-supabase/neon\#set-your-newdburl-environment-variable)

Set the **NEW\_DB\_URL** environment variable at the command line using your Supabase connection string. You will need to replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual database password.

Example:

`
export NEW_DB_URL="postgresql://postgres.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"
`

## Migrate the database [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-to-supabase/neon\#migrate-the-database)

You will need the [pg\_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) and [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) command line tools, which are included in a full [Postgres installation](https://www.postgresql.org/download).

1. Export your database to a file in console

Use `pg_dump` with your Postgres credentials to export your database to a file (e.g., `dump.sql`).


`
pg_dump "$OLD_DB_URL" \
  --clean \
  --if-exists \
  --quote-all-identifiers \
  --no-owner \
  --no-privileges \
> dump.sql
`

2. Import the database to your Supabase project

Use `psql` to import the Postgres database file to your Supabase project.



`
psql -d "$NEW_DB_URL" -f dump.sql
`


Additional options

- To only migrate a single database schema, add the `--schema=PATTERN` parameter to your `pg_dump` command.
- To exclude a schema: `--exclude-schema=PATTERN`.
- To only migrate a single table: `--table=PATTERN`.
- To exclude a table: `--exclude-table=PATTERN`.

Run `pg_dump --help` for a full list of options.

- If you're planning to migrate a database larger than 6 GB, we recommend [upgrading to at least a Large compute add-on](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/compute-add-ons). This will ensure you have the necessary resources to handle the migration efficiently.

- For databases smaller than 150 GB, you can increase the size of the disk on paid projects by navigating to [Database Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database).

- If you're dealing with a database larger than 150 GB, we strongly advise you to [contact our support team](https://supabase.com/dashboard/support/new) for assistance in provisioning the required resources and ensuring a smooth migration process.
