Database

# Querying Joins and Nested tables

* * *

The data APIs automatically detect relationships between Postgres tables. Since Postgres is a relational database, this is a very common scenario.

## One-to-many joins [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/joins-and-nesting\#one-to-many-joins)

Let's use an example database that stores `orchestral_sections` and `instruments`:

TablesSQL

**Orchestral sections**

| `id` | `name` |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | strings |
| 2 | woodwinds |

**Instruments**

| `id` | `name` | `section_id` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | violin | 1 |
| 2 | viola | 1 |
| 3 | flute | 2 |
| 4 | oboe | 2 |

The APIs will automatically detect relationships based on the foreign keys:

JavaScriptDartSwiftKotlinPythonGraphQLURL

``
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('orchestral_sections').select(`
id,
name,
instruments ( id, name )
`)
``

### TypeScript types for joins [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/joins-and-nesting\#typescript-types-for-joins)

`supabase-js` always returns a `data` object (for success), and an `error` object (for unsuccessful requests).

These helper types provide the result types from any query, including nested types for database joins.

Given the following schema with a relation between orchestral sections and instruments:

`
create table orchestral_sections (
"id" serial primary key,
"name" text
);
create table instruments (
"id" serial primary key,
"name" text,
"section_id" int references "orchestral_sections"
);
`

We can get the nested `SectionsWithInstruments` type like this:

``
import { QueryResult, QueryData, QueryError } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
const sectionsWithInstrumentsQuery = supabase.from('orchestral_sections').select(`
id,
name,
instruments (
    id,
    name
)
`)
type SectionsWithInstruments = QueryData<typeof sectionsWithInstrumentsQuery>
const { data, error } = await sectionsWithInstrumentsQuery
if (error) throw error
const sectionsWithInstruments: SectionsWithInstruments = data
``

## Many-to-many joins [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/joins-and-nesting\#many-to-many-joins)

The data APIs will detect many-to-many joins. For example, if you have a database which stored teams of users (where each user could belong to many teams):

`
create table users (
"id" serial primary key,
"name" text
);
create table teams (
"id" serial primary key,
"team_name" text
);
create table members (
"user_id" int references users,
"team_id" int references teams,
primary key (user_id, team_id)
);
`

In these cases you don't need to explicitly define the joining table (members). If we wanted to fetch all the teams and the members in each team:

JavaScriptDartSwiftKotlinPythonGraphQLURL

``
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('teams').select(`
id,
team_name,
users ( id, name )
`)
``

## Specifying the `ON` clause for joins with multiple foreign keys [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/joins-and-nesting\#specifying-the-on-clause-for-joins-with-multiple-foreign-keys)

For example, if you have a project that tracks when employees check in and out of work shifts:

`
-- Employees
create table users (
"id" serial primary key,
"name" text
);
-- Badge scans
create table scans (
"id" serial primary key,
"user_id" int references users,
"badge_scan_time" timestamp
);
-- Work shifts
create table shifts (
"id" serial primary key,
"user_id" int references users,
"scan_id_start" int references scans, -- clocking in
"scan_id_end" int references scans, -- clocking out
"attendance_status" text
);
`

In this case, you need to explicitly define the join because the joining column on `shifts` is ambiguous as they are both referencing the `scans` table.

To fetch all the `shifts` with `scan_id_start` and `scan_id_end` related to a specific `scan`, use the following syntax:

JavaScriptDartSwiftKotlinPythonGraphQL

``
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('shifts').select(
`
    *,
    start_scan:scans!scan_id_start (
      id,
      user_id,
      badge_scan_time
    ),
end_scan:scans!scan_id_end (
     id,
     user_id,
     badge_scan_time
    )
`
)
``
