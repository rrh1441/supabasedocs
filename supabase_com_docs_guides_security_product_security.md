# Secure configuration of Supabase products

* * *

The Supabase [production checklist](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/deployment/going-into-prod) provides detailed advice on preparing an app for production. While our [SOC 2](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/security/soc-2-compliance) and [HIPAA](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/security/hipaa-compliance) compliance documents outline the roles and responsibilities for building a secure and compliant app.
